<h1 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p align="center">
I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at Northeastern University, focused on human-computer interaction, data-driven design, and user-centered systems. As a career-changer, I bring strong communication and project management skills to technical teams and enjoy building tools that solve real-world problems.
